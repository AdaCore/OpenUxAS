Building Uxas
=============

If you are part of AdaCore:

$ ./install_env # (only once)
$ . ./setup_env
$ ./anod-build uxas

If not be sure to have in your environment:

* a C++ compiler,
* Java,
* Cmake,
* a Python distribution with https://github.com/AdaCore/e3-core
  (branch e3transition). Soon it will be available using pip install e3-core

Then call the anod-build script
